# ABC - A Block Chain
A block chain (ABC) is a project intended to explore the underlying technology of block chains and cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. This project will be built in python for simplicity and readability so that users/readers can explore the code in the learning process. This article is intended to provide readers a better understanding of how cryptocurrencies like bitcoin work and how to go about developing a simple block-chain implementation.

The core functions we will discuss, explore and develop are the following:
1. Creating blocks
2. Mining blocks
3. Communication with other nodes
4. Proof of work algorithms
5. Transactions
